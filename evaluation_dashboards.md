# Evaluation dashboards

There are several software products or services that provide dashboards useful for evaluation. Each of them have different characteristics, and are useful in different parts of the evaluation process, or for different areas of evaluation. In this chapter we introduce some of them.

## The Open Hub dashboard

[Open HUB](http://openhub.net), formerly known as Ohloh, is a website maintained by BlackDuck. Among other services, it provides a software development dashboard for a very large collection of projects (at least, tens of thousands of them).

All the information provided by Open HUB is based on the analysis of SCM. It includes both the analysis of the contents (licensing, lines of code, programming languages) and the metainformation (commits, committers, etc).

The dashboard offers several views, each showing a different aspect of the project. The main page is a summary of the parameters of the project, and in some cases provides enough parameters for a basic assessment about its activity, and the size of the code produced. Then, there are specific panels showing analysis by programming language, and by lines of code, activity and developers.

The main interest of Open HUB is probably the huge number of projects for which they offer information. It is very like that if you look for any even minimally known project, Open HUB maintains a dashboard for it.
