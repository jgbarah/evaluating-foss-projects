# Evaluation dashboards

There are several software products or services that provide dashboards useful for evaluation. Each of them have different characteristics, and are useful in different parts of the evaluation process, or for different areas of evaluation. In this chapter we introduce some of them.

## The Open Hub dashboard

[Open HUB](http://openhub.com), formerly known as Ohloh, is a website maintained by BlackDuck. Among other services, it provides a software development dashboard for a very large collection of projects (at least, tens of thousands of them).
